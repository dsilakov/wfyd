    <emphasis>Creating Entries</emphasis>

           Entries are line items associated with a project.  An entry
           consists of a start time, an amount of time spent, and a
           series of notes describing what happened during this
           period.

<para>
        When you first start <application>WFYD</application>, you see
        the <interface>Main window</interface>, as shown in 
  <xref linkend="mainwindowfig"/>.

        </figure>
<!-- ==============End of Figure=================================== -->
</para>      


      <para>
      The main window consists of five areas. There is a menu bar at
      the top of the window, a project list and a set of buttons below
      the menu bar, a notes entry window, and an entry list for the
      currently selected project.  There is also a status bar at the
      bottom of the window.
</para>

<para>

      When you start <application>WFYD</application> for the first
      time, the project list, the notes entry window, and the entry
      list will be empty.
</para>

<para>      You cannot add an entry unless a project is selected.

      Add a new project by typing its name into the project list entry box.
</para>
<para>


      To start an entry that will be applied to the currently selected
      project, click the <guibutton>Add</guibutton> button near the top
      left of the main window.  When you do so, the button will display
      the current time spent on this entry in minutes.  Clicking the button
      again will stop the timer and add the entry to the entry list for
      the currently selected project.
</para>

<para>
      Notes typed into the notes field will be entered into the entry
      when the entry has been completed.

      You can also start a new entry by simply starting to type into
      the notes box if the timer isn't currently running.

      You can end an entry by pressing ctrl-G instead of clicking on
      the <guibutton>Add</guibutton> button.

</para>

<para>
      If you've configured WFYD to with a "nag interval" (see the
      Preferences section of this manual), the main WFYD window will
      present itself to you every so often while you're working.
</para>    

<para>
      To edit an existing entry, double-click on its entry field in the entry
      list.  The <interface>Edit Entry</interface> window 
as shown in
