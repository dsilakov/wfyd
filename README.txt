About WFYD

    WFYD is a simple time tracker written for GNOME.

Requirements

    GNOME 2, PyGTK 2.6+.

    The program runs unmodified on Fedora Core 4 with the stock
    set of packages (since Fedora's system configuration tools
    also use PyGTK).

Installation

    No installation is required or supported yet.

Running

    Enter the software directory and run "wfyd.py":

        $ cd wfyd-0.1
        $ ./wfyd.py

    The main window will be displayed.  For usage help,
    see the Help -> Contents button.
