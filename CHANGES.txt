1.1
   'Last active day' filter in the Journals window now doesn't take the
   current day into account.
   If wfyd is running for a long time, the main window will be cleaned up
   once a day to contain records for last two days only.

   Issue fix - creation of a new ddatabase led to undefined 'projectname'
   variable.

   Last active project is remembered now and selected automatically
   when the application starts.

   Fixed bug that prevented entries in the main window to be deleted.
   
   One more bug fix - modification of calendar values in the 
   Journals window sometimes didn't actually change time interval.

   Added 'Last Active Day', 'Last Week', 'Last Month' filters to the journals window.
   Data for the last month is displayed by default.

   Status bar now displays total time spent on tasks selected in the
   task box in both main and journals windows.

   Added support for packaging / running as a setuptools-created egg
   (thanks to Tres Seaver).

   should be displayed.
   
   Export to text file is available.

   systems.

   yelp binary path was incorrect on some platforms which meant the
