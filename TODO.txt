  See http://www.daa.com.au/pipermail/pygtk/2004-February/006954.html

Add entries manually.

Cut and paste entries.

Drag-select multiple entries for deletion.

Round up to the nearest minute in entries.

Incremental search of entries.

Billable/nonbillable flag.

iTunes-like selectors for project and period filters.

Add a menu item for Find in Current View.

Journals window is not very fast for long periods (~1 year) with huge 
number of records

If any entry visible in the main window is modified in the 'journal' one,
the change is not reflected in the main table.

'nag' state now only prints 'Nagging' in the statusbar;
it would be useful to attach a message with the total idle time 
to the task description, (or display idle time to user in some other way)
